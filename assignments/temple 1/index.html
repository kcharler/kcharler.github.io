        <p>The Accra Ghana Temple is the 117th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
            (LDS Church).

            The building of the Accra Ghana Temple was announced on February 16, 1998.[1] Years before the temple
            was announced, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley had promised members in the area they would
            someday have a temple close by. When the temple was announced Hinckley also told those in attendance
            that the church had been trying to find a place to build a temple in Ghana for five years. The temple
            in Accra is the second of three temples built in Africa

            <h2>The Temple Gives Us Higher Vision</h2>

            <p>Some of our most vivid and significant memories of living in the midwestern United States as young
                parents are of yearly visits to the temple in Washington, D.C. At the time, it was the only temple in
                operation east of the Mississippi River. Knowing that temple ordinances are essential for all of
                Heavenly Father’s children gave a sense of urgency to our efforts.
            </p>

            <p>Like many of you, we arranged for friends to care for our small children, traveled through the night
                with a busload of fellow members, spent a couple of precious days doing as much temple work as we
                could, and then rode the bus home through the night so we could attend our Church meetings on Sunday.
                Those trips did not seem to be sacrifices; they were cherished because of the spiritual uplift that fed
                our souls for months afterward.
            </p>

            <p> A few years later, we were thrilled to welcome the Chicago Illinois Temple, the first temple built in
                the North America Central Area since the Cardston Alberta Temple 62 years earlier. With a temple only
                45 minutes from our home, it was a joy for us to attend more often than once a year and to receive that
                spiritual food on a regular basis.
            </p>

            <p> Yet today, though some of us live within closer reach of a temple, we may still find it difficult to
                attend frequently. It may be that the easier availability of a temple lulls us into thinking, “I’ll go
                tomorrow, when I have more time.” It is easy to become distracted by immediate pressures and let more
                important opportunities slide away. Elder Richard G. Scott (1928–2015) of the Quorum of the Twelve
                Apostles said, “I encourage you to establish your own goal of how frequently you will avail yourself of
                the ordinances offered in our operating temples.”
            </p>

            <p> If we neglect the opportunity to attend as often as our circumstances allow, if we take lightly the
                opportunity to go to the temple when it is right in our backyard, so to speak, we may forfeit future
                blessings and opportunities our Father and His Son have in store for us. “I, the Lord,” He said, “am
                bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise” (D&C 82:10).
